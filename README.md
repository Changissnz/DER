**DER**

This project is called DER. I will let the interpretation
of that fall upon your shoulders.

Update: 11/12

The DER is a digital tool still in progress. I am planning for the completion to not be utilized as an object as dark as the sword I am talking about by dragging this sentence past the appropriate length but yet still fine with it under the enthusiasm necessary for such expressivity that can only defy certain principles with both powers and potentials necessary to conduct required requirements that may?

SCHEDULE
--------

10/31/21
- Some of the functions and classes do not work as intended. Another key issue is the project structure. That is the next task.

11/1/21
- Restructuring Phase I completed. Some classes are unstable and testing is needed.

11/4/21
- Refactoring for file `rssi.py`.
- Make a noise adder class for `CenterResplat` to use.
- numerical space sample generator
  - will save to file

11/7/21
- Working on additional components for `numerical space sample generator`

11/8/21
- Worked on `class<RChainHead>`.
- Test for `relevance_functions_test2. sample_rssi_1_with_update` now works

11/11/21
- `class<ChainedLagrangePolySolver>` will fail on
some point-set cases.
- Starting work on `class<MessageStreamer>`:
  - requires 3rd-party libraries => project needs a `requirements` file

11/12/21
- add file `point_weight_functions`; requires clean-up.
- `class<NSDataInstructions>` does not work for the following case:
    - type(rm[0]) is np.ndarray

11/13/21
- work from yesterday is no longer required.

11/14/21
- all plans for NLP have been removed; "French Idioms and Proverbs" from project is no longer needed.

11/18/21
- working on `noise capabilities` for `class<NSDataInstructions>`.

11/19/21
- Removed `indep/2e321b-300__EasternPoisonOak.jpg`,
  `indep/3492d6-300__WesternPoisonIvy.jpg`, and `indep/aa04b6-300__WesternPoisonOak.jpg` from project.

11/21/21
- time will be dedicated this week to completing `class<BallComp>`.

12/24/21
- still working on `class<BallComp>`. I have been swamped, but hopefully,
  the algorithm should be working next week.
